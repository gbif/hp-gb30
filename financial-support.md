- Node managers from other Voting Participants and Associate Participant countries, based on their level of activity and contributions to GBIF
- Node managers from Associate Participant organizations, based on level of activity and contributions to GBIF

Only one person per Participant, the Node manager, is eligible to apply for partial support. 

### Governing Board meeting, 18-19 October 2023
