The GBIF Secretariat offers the possibility of applying for partial financial support to attend 1) the Nodes Training and Global Nodes meeting on 15-17 October 2023 and/or 2) the Governing Board meeting on 18-19 October 2023. Support may include partial funding of economy-class flight tickets and a subsidy to cover accommodation.  

**The application process is now open**  

Please see below for more details on the guidelines for seeking partial funding for the events. Link to the application form can be found at the bottom of this page. 

Deadline for applying is **30 May 2023**.  

The GBIF Secretariat will inform applicants about the outcome of their application shortly after the deadline. 

## Events covered

### Nodes Training and Global Nodes meeting, 15-17 October 2023

Partial financial support is only available to those who will attend both the Nodes Training and Global Nodes meeting. 

Only one person per Participant, the node manager or designated alternate, is eligible to apply for partial support. 

As the funds available are limited, the requests for support will be prioritized as follows:
- Node managers/alternates from Voting Participant countries which are in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions
- Node managers/alternates from other Voting Participants and Associate Participant countries
- Node managers/alternates from Associate Participant organizations

### Governing Board meeting, 18-19 October 2023

Partial financial support for the Governing Board meeting is only available for GBIF Voting Participants representing developing countries and in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions.  

Developing countries are defined as countries whose per capita GDP was less than USD 13,500 according to the 2020 World Bank figures, the benchmark used to apply discounted contributions in the current GBIF funding period (2023-2027). See list of developing GBIF country members [here](/assets/documents/GB30_VP_developing_countries.pdf).  

Only one person per Voting Participant, the Head of Delegation, is eligible to apply for partial support. However, the Head of Delegation can reassign the support to a member of the delegation. 

### Attending both the Nodes Training and Global Nodes meeting and the Governing Board meeting?

Individuals attending both the Nodes Training and Global Nodes meeting and the Governing Board meeting may apply for support for one return flight and accommodation to cover the period of both events. 


## How to apply

The application form must include the following information:
