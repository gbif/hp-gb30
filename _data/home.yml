    About our Sponsors  
    The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure. ALA is a collaborative, digital, open database that pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, making them accessible and reusable. With over 100 million species occurrence records to date, ALA creates a more detailed picture of Australia’s biodiversity, enabling scientists, policy makers, environmental planners and land managers, industry and the general public to work more efficiently. 

    National Research Collections Australia is Australia’s national biological collection focused on discovering, exploring and managing Australia’s unique biodiversity.  The collection consists of 15+ million specimens of plants and animals from Australia and the Indo-pacific region along with associated tissue samples, DNA sequences, images and metadata.  The collection supports research on biodiversity discovery, biosecurity, bioprospecting, indigenous knowledge, environmental monitoring and ecosystem management.
